Welcome to HyLord Server Util. Simplest of setups:

<h1>Step 1: Download</h1>
Go to the latest Release
<h1>Step 2: Copy</h1>
Open the HyLord_Release_<version>.zip file and copy the 5 files into your server folder with Hytale server, and Assets in the same directory.

<h1>Step 3: Run</h1>
OpenHyLordServerUtil.exe to start the server utility and begin your adventure! 
HLSU will create any missing neccessary config files and folders. the config.json, as well as a world settings config with a random seed.
<h1>Step 4: Config</h1>
From here, press the Config tab to change the settings of your server and world. They're separated into groups.

<h1>Step 5: Start Server</h1>
Now that it's all configured, start the server with the button in the top right corner!
<h1>Step 6: Auth</h1>
If you've launched the server before and just adding HyLord as a layer for simplicity, nothing else is needed. The server will run as normal, but with extra monitoring.
If this is your first launch, you'll need to follow the instructions in the Console tab. Auth is automatically set to Encrypt and save.
Type /auth login browser and copy/paste the URL into your browser of choice. (I'll be adding a button for this in a future update)
Once authed, press Restart to restart the server with your new auth token.
